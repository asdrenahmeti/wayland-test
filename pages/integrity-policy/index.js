            Wayland LLC, Inform Wayland DOO, and Inform Innovation Inc.
            (“Wayland”; the “Company”; “We”) demands the highest standards of
            integrity and ethical conduct in its business dealings. We will not
            tolerate any bribery or corrupt practices related to our business
            activities from our employees or business partners. We are committed
            to transparent reporting and to taking all other reasonable measures
            which avoid Wayland’s involvement in bribery or corruption.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            Bribery and corruption undermine the rule of law and the principle
            of fair competition. Such activities entrench bad governance,
            hindering efforts to alleviate poverty and often contributing to
            economic instability and human rights abuses. Whilst the risk of
            bribery exists in all geographies, sectors and transactions, Wayland
            understands that steps can be taken to mitigate the inherent risk of
            corrupt behavior. This Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy (the
            “Policy”) aims to inform Wayland management, employees and business
            partners about our intention to closely monitor corruption risk and
            to take immediate action if evidence of corrupt activity is
            suspected.

          </div>
          <p>
            Wayland recognizes that reasonable and proportionate gifts and
            hospitality are a legitimate contribution to good business
            relationships between Wayland and its business partners. However,
            judgement must be used to ensure these are reasonable and ethical.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">For instance:</p>
          <ul className="ml-4 my-4 list-disc list-inside marker:text-w-orange flex flex-col gap-[6px]">
            <li>
              The cost or expense of a gift, meal or entertainment must be
              reasonable and in good faith directly connected to a legitimate
              business promotional activity or the performance of existing
              contracts
            </li>
            <li>
              When considering what is a reasonable expense, Wayland Employees
              should consider the frequency with which such expenses are
              incurred for a particular official
            </li>
            <li>
              Wayland Employees are forbidden from soliciting gifts or
              hospitality, and Wayland Employees must endeavor to avoid
              conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest
            </li>
            <li>
              Some examples of impermissible gifts include:
              <ul className="ml-4 my-4 list-disc list-inside marker:text-w-orange flex flex-col gap-[6px]">
                <li>
                  Any gift or entertainment that would be illegal (including
                  anything offered to a government official in breach of local
                  or international bribery laws)
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Any gift or entertainment that is a ‘quid pro quo’ (offered
                  for something in return) or
                </li>
                <li>

              Supply Chain Risk Management
            </h2>

          <p>
            When selecting potential business partners, Wayland endeavors to
            work with those that are likeminded in their approach to maintaining
            high ethical standards as well as demonstrated legal and regulatory
            compliance. Wayland will include risk management measures in its
            procurement practices, for example:
          </p>
          <ul className="ml-4 my-4 list-disc list-inside marker:text-w-orange flex flex-col gap-[6px]">
            <li>
              Wayland’s contractual terms will contain an ethical policy,
              including a statement on bribery and corruption.
            </li>
            <li>
              Before entering into a new contractual relationship, Wayland will
              undertake:

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Once the business relationship is successfully approved, periodical
            review of the business relationships will be ongoing, although the
            level of oversight required will vary depending on the risks
            identified upon initial assessment.
